<h1>BLIND AND BET RULES</h1>
<ol>
<li><b>The minimum bet or raise is the amount of the BB (big blind), except for ALL-IN.</b></li>
<li><b>A raise must be at least equal to the amount of the previous bet or raise.</b><br/>
Example : FLOP / TURN / RIVER
<ul>
<li>player 0 : <b>BET 200</b> (raise is $200)</li>
<li>player 1 : <b>BET 500</b> (raise is $300)</li>
<li>player 2 : <b>BET 800</b> (raise is still $300)</li>
<li>player 0 : <b>CALL</b> (add $600)</li>
<li>player 1 : <b>CALL</b> (add $300)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>If one ALL-IN is not enough to be considered as a raise, it doesn't re-open the betting.</b><br/>
Example : FLOP / TURN / RIVER
<ul>
<li>player 0 : <b>BET 200</b> (raise is $200)</li>
<li>player 1 : <b>ALL-IN</b> for $300 (adding $100 is not enough to re-open the raise)</li>
<li>player 2 : <b>BET 400</b> (raise is still $200)</li>
<li>player 0 : <b>CALL</b> (add $200)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>PREFLOP everyone with chips must put in at least one BB, even if one or more of the blinds are all-in for less.</b><br/>
Example : PREFLOP (blinds are $10 / $20 and player 0 is the big blind and directly ALL-IN for $5)<br/>
<ul>
<li>player 1 : <b>CALL</b> (add $10 to his $10 already in the pot)</li>
<li>player 2 : <b>CALL</b> (add $10 also...)</li>
</ul>
</li> 
<li><b>After the FLOP a player can call an ALL-IN for less than a BB.</b><br/>
Example : FLOP / TURN / RIVER (blinds are $10 / $20)<br/>
<ul>
<li>player 0 : <b>ALL-IN</b> for $10</li>
<li>player 1 : <b>CALL</b> (add only $10)</li>
</ul>
</li> 
<li><b>If a player's stack is larger than the SB (small blind) but smaller than the BB, he will be considered ALL-IN in any position other than the SB (assuming he folds).</b>
</li>
<li>To avoid <b>'infinite' raises</b> (every player raises by one BB). There's a <b>"cap"</b> (limit) of 10 raises by betting round.
</li>
</ol>
