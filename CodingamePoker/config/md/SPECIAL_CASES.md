Here are some <b>"limit" cases</b> and how  the referee handles them :
<ol>
<li>The minimum bet is the amount of the BB (big blind), except for ALL-IN.</li>
<li>PREFLOP if the BB's player is directly ALL-IN for less than a SB (small blind), the other players must add a SB to CALL (they can't CHECK).</li> 
<li>After the FLOP a player can call an ALL-IN for less than a BB.</li>
<li>If a player's stack is larger than the SB but smaller than the BB, he will be considered ALL-IN in any position other than the SB (assuming he folds).</li>
<li>A raise must be at least equal to the amount of the previous bet or raise.</li>
<li>If one ALL-IN is not enough to be considered as as a raise, it doesn't re-open the betting.</li>
<li>In heads up : the SB is the dealer.</li>
</ol>
