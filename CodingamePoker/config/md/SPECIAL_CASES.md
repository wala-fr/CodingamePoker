in case one all-in is not enough to be considered as as a raise
If the player's stack is larger than the small blind but smaller than the big blind, they will be considered all-in in any position other than the small blind (assuming they fold for their option).
In heads up : the small blind is the dealer.
Modern poker rules require that raises must be at least equal to the amount of the previous bet or raise.
the minimum bet allowed at any given time is equivalent to the amount of the big blind. 
Bet must meet the minimum of twice the previous bet.  Call bet amount and raise exactly that amount or more
Alternatively, if there is no previous bet, the first bet must be at least the big blind
