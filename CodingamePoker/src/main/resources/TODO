
raise small blind and big blind
give smallBlind and bigBlind in game input


if bet less than call => consider calling (won't be a problem if bet is RAISE)

Modern poker rules require that raises must be at least equal to the amount of the previous bet or raise.
the minimum bet allowed at any given time is equivalent to the amount of the big blind. 

the action moves clockwise around the table

//Bet must meet the minimum of twice the previous bet.  Call bet amount and raise exactly that amount or more
//Alternatively, if there is no previous bet, the first bet must be at least the big blind
