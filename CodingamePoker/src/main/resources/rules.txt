the last hand if not finished is cancelled. scores are the one at the start

        // If the player's stack is larger than the small blind but smaller than the big blind,
            // they will be considered all-in in any position other than the small blind, assuming
            // they fold for their option.
            
 in some case if th action is ilegal the referee replace it with a legal one : for example RAISE with an amount strictly superior to the player stack => ALL-IN...
 
 level and blind increment every 10 hand 
 
 possible actions RAISE, FOLD...
